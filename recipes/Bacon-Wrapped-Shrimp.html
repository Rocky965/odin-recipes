        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A crazy twist! bacon and shrimp you say? Yup, say less a bunch of shrimp cooked with bacon wrapped around it not to mention the cajun seasoning and hot honey exploding inside your mouth with flavor the only downside with this dish is that you can never have enough. </p>
